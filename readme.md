Merge Server
===================

Static file server which merges multiple directory paths into a single directory
structure. Includes directory listing of the combined directory structure.

This is primarily useful as a development server which coalesces source and
output directories into a single directory structure, without having them
combined in reality.

Usage:

```shell
yarn run start
```
